## Roadmap

- **Decouple UI and Logic**
  - Use the `AbstractCore` server to separate all application logic and processing from the user interface.

- **Unified Experience: Desktop & Web**
  - Serve both the system tray message bubble *and* a full-featured web interface for enhanced capability and better usability.

- **Advanced Agent Architecture**
  - Transition from basic LLM with tools (`AbstractCore`) to the more powerful `AbstractAgent` architecture, enabling richer interactions and tool use.

- **Media & Repository Integration**
  - Add support for media file handling and enable indexing/searching of entire code repositories for context-aware responses.
